## A Hand Wavy Defense of "Domaining"

I have really mixed feelings about [domaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_speculation). I've been way, _way_ overcharged for domains that I've wanted and I've also bought a few domains explicitly to sell.

Most of the online discourse around domaining never seems to give a credible defense of what domainers do. What they do _feels_ like being gouged for an entry on a database somewhere, but is there actual value there? I'm not sure, but I'd like to try to cobble together *some defense* that goes beyond the normal - often very bad - arguments, such as...

## "It's just like real estate!"

Most domainers will retort that domaining is no different than real estate speculation. You buy some asset in an area that you think will grow, sit on it for a while until the growth happens, and then sell it.

I'd like to note two things here. One, this is still not good and is pretty obviously [rent seeking behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking). Another industry doing a similarly sh**** thing is not really a good defense of what you're doing.

Second, it's not really like real estate speculation at all *other than the rent seeking*.

### Domains have near zero costs

Maintaining a domain costs essentially nothing. There's a $12 to $80 a year registration fee and that's... pretty much it.

Compare this with real estate deals which often cost tens of thousands of dollars in upfront costs and then thousands of dollars each year in taxes (we'll talk more about this later). The higher upfront cost is a good thing here, since it prevents charlatans from entering the market. Buyers who don't care and are just out to extract value have a super low barrier to entry and they exploit this - a lot!

I think a lot about the 8chan owner who bought the pokiman domain and turned it into a porn site. Had the upfront cost been significantly higher, would he have done this? Probably not.

Domains are far more similar to stocks in this regard - anybody can buy a stock - and anybody can buy a domain.

This is pure speculation - but I'd also guess that the lower costs provide fewer incentives to develop the space. A larger investment and upkeep means you're more invested in the outcome.

### Average people don't care about dead domains

Domains are kind of funny in that a really good domain is extremely valuable, but highly valuable, dead domains don't bother people. Say my local city's .com domain is being squatted and redirecting to one of those awful landing pages littered with ads. That's bad and annoying, but most people will just Google their city, redirect to the .org or .gov or whatever and then be done with it. And that's it?

Real estate actually *doesn't* behave this way. If you abandon a lot in a highly coveted area, you'll get fined by the city for neglect, your taxes will increase, and numerous local city councils, governments, 311 services, etc. will hound you incessently. Which they should! You've just abandonded a key part of the community.

For better or for worse, most people don't see the internet that way. A great .com being abandonded isn't something to write your congressman about, it's an annoyance.

## Domainers provide a marketplace

Domainers speculating on and buying/selling domains are providing a marketplace. That's their value add. Let's think of the counterfactual world - there is no domain marketplace. No GoDaddy, no Afternic, no Dan(.com), whatever. 

People have a very fanciful view of what this would look like: I'd login to some central registrar, get the domain for $12 and go on my way.

I don't actually think this would happen. Again, domain costs are *so low* that I think people would just buy them and sit on them. Every person since the inception of the internet who's ever had the idea to develop the domain would just buy it and say "oh eventually I'm going to do something with this." There's no incentive to sell them because there's no market and there's no incentive to drop them because they're so cheap to hold.

Domainers are a necessary evil - yes they're gouging you for a database entry somewhere - but I still think this is a better world than one where you *can never buy the entry at all*. They provide the market forces which keep people moving domains around and the relatively painless buying/selling process. Without them, you'd have a stale internet full of dead links with unreachable contacts.
