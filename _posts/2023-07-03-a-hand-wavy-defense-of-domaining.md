## A Hand Wavy Defense of "Domaining"

I have really mixed feelings about [domaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_speculation). I've been way, _way_ overcharged for domains that I've wanted and I've also bought a few domains explicitly to sell.

Most of the online discourse around domaining never seems to give a credible defense of what domainers do. What they do _feels_ like being gouged for an entry on a database somewhere, but is there actual value there? I'm not sure, but I'd like to try to cobble together *some defense* that goes beyond the normal - often very bad - arguments.

## "It's just like real estate!"

Most domainers will retort that domaining is no different than real estate speculation. You buy some asset in an area that you think will grow, sit on it for a while until the growth happens, and then sell it.

I'd like to note two things here. One, this is still not good and is pretty obviously rent seeking behavior.
