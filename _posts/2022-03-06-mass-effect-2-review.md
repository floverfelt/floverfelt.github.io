[Mass Effect 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2) is a phenomenal game.

I played it back in 2011 or so when it came out but I'd largely forgotten everything that happened in it, other than the broad strokes of the plot. It's far, far better than I remember it being and is truly one of the greatest games I've played.

## Comparison to ME1

I reviewed [Mass Effect 1](https://floverfelt.org/posts/mass-effect-review) and felt that the game was stretching it's legs in a new universe. It was a vibrant and brilliantly built world wrapped in a conventional story with lackluster combat.

Mass Effect 2 ratchets all of the themes from Mass Effect 1 up, a lot. The world is (literally at times) darker, the ethical dilemmas are sharper and more poignant, and the character writing has been deeply fleshed out. 

In fact, the starkest difference between the two games to me is that the characters *are the game* in Mass Effect 2. Mass Effect 1 has decent character writing, but it's a sideshow to the "heroic human on a quest to save humanity." It's a very good sideshow, but it nevertheless takes the backstage to Shephard's quest.

Mass Effect 2 inverts this and most of the other presuppositions from Mass Effect 1.

You're no longer a Spectre, the paragon of humanity, but instead working for an ethically murky terrorist (?) organization? You're no longer learning about the genophage, you're deciding if you should cure it. You're no longer reporting to, well, anyone but yourself and nobody really likes you.

It's a really clever twist on all the plotlines of the first ME game, forcing you to actually tackle the abundant galactic grey areas that the original introduced.

## Mass Effect 2 is a Heist Movie

Mass Effect 1 plays out a lot like a traditional action/adventure movie. The hero is called to action, he answers the call and, against all odds, prevails for good.

Mass Effect 2 plays like a heist movie, where halfway you through you realize the heist isn't actually the point of the movie. The central conceit of the game is that you need to "build your team" to go on a mission into deep space - through the ominous Omega 4 relay. You need to assemble a squad capable of performing such a feat! It's really reminiscient of [Ocean's 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)) at a meta level.

The thing is, the actual missions beyond the Omega 4 relay are... pretty trivial? They're not all that much more difficult than any of the other missions and the final boss is laughably stupid. What's more, those missions are realtively quick? I think I completed the final sections of the game in an hour or two compared to 12+ hours prepping for them.

Again, it's an interesting subversion of player expectations. The end (your typical video game climax) is not the best part of the game. The best part is the journey to get there. Which is exactly the way *a story based game* should be! 

It's amazing that they not only picked up on this, but found a format ("the heist") which lent itself to thorough personalization of side characters so naturally. It makes sense that we spend a lot of time getting to know Grunt (for example) in Mass Effect 2 since the game is based on the assumption that he's going to play an enormous role in events beyond the Omega 4 relay. The same way it makes sense that heist movies spend a lot of time focusing on "the driver" or "the hustler" - you'll know they'll be important later, even if they're a side character.

Mass Effect 2, despite the praise I've heaped on it thus far, has a few eye roll moments, and
