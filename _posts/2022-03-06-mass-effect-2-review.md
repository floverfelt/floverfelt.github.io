[Mass Effect 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2) is a phenomenal game.

I played it back in 2011 or so when it came out but I'd largely forgotten everything that happened in it, other than the broad strokes of the plot. It's far, far better than I remember it being and is truly one of the greatest games I've played.

## Comparison to ME1

I reviewed [Mass Effect 1](https://floverfelt.org/posts/mass-effect-review) and felt that the game was stretching it's legs in a new universe. It was a vibrant and brilliantly built world wrapped in a conventional story with lackluster combat.

Mass Effect 2 ratchets all of the themes from Mass Effect 1 up, a lot. The world is (literally at times) darker, the ethical dilemmas are sharper and more poignant, and the character writing has been deeply fleshed out. 

In fact, the starkest difference between the two games to me is that the characters *are the game* in Mass Effect 2. Mass Effect 1 has decent character writing, but it's a sideshow to the "heroic human on a quest to save humanity." It's a very good sideshow, but it nevertheless takes the backstage to Shephard's quest.

Mass Effect 2 inverts this and most of the other presuppositions from Mass Effect 1.

You're no longer a Spectre, the paragon of humanity, but instead working for an ethically murky terrorist (?) organization? You're no longer learning about the genophage, you're deciding if you should cure it. You're no longer reporting to, well, anyone but yourself.

It's a really clever twist on all the plotlines of the first ME game, forcing you to actually tackle the abundant galactic grey areas that the original introduced.
