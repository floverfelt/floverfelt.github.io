Remote work has been a pretty typical thing for the last two years and we're starting to hit the inflection point where people wonder if the office really wasn't so bad. Think of the productivity gains! The water cooler talk! The spontaneous ideation!

Lest we all forget, this was my experience coming into the office.

## Context

I worked at a medium sized healthcare technology company that got acquired by a *really big* healthcare technology company. Since this was my first job out of college, I decided to go into the office everyday for the first year to prove... something? I'm still not sure what, exactly, but remote work didn't really appeal to me at the time and the gym was a half-block away from work so I knew I'd be going to the office to go to the gym later most days anyway.

Since I was already going to that location, I'll skip over all the issues with commuting and let's just focus on what being in the physical office was like. This is a narrative, bulleted list.

## Office Experiences

### The first year-ish...

- Since we were a tech (tm) company, we had to have an open office. There were half wall dividers between the rows and no gaps between the seats in the rows. This was pretty miserable because everytime myself and the other new hire wanted to discuss *anything* between us (i.e. how to install Java), we had to do it in front of the row of senior engineers and managers. I don't they cared, but it was embarassing all the same.

- Three quarters of the team came in, *maybe*, one day a week. This included both of the tech leads I had for the first two years at the job. The rest of the team came in either everyday (me) or three times a week/however much they felt like.

- In my entire 4 years on that team, there was only *1* day where every single person on our 8ish person team were all there at the same time.

- If even 1 person is remote, meetings become an entirely new added responsibility for the team in the office. Somebody has to reserve the meeting room, come in a little early to the meeting room, setup the phones, hook up their laptop to the projector, and dial into the call. This resulted in either all our meetings starting 5 minutes late, or one of the engineers having the designated responsibility of "meeting runner" and showing up 5 minutes earlier. I always found this a little cruel that the people who'd already sacrificed some of their day by coming into the office then get *another* responsibility to account for the people who didn't bother to come in.

- We had a foosball table because we were a tech (tm) company,
