Remote work has been a pretty typical thing for the last two years and we're starting to hit the inflection point where people wonder if the office really wasn't so bad. Think of the productivity gains! The water cooler talk! The spontaneous ideation!

Lest we all forget, this was my experience coming into the office.

## Context

I worked at a medium sized healthcare technology company that got acquired by a *really big* healthcare technology company. Since this was my first job out of college, I decided to go into the office everyday for the first year to prove... something? I'm still not sure what, exactly, but remote work didn't really appeal to me at the time and the gym was a half-block away from work so I knew I'd be going to the office to go to the gym later most days anyway.

Since I was already going to that location, I'll skip over all the issues with commuting and let's just focus on what being in the physical office was like. This is a narrative, bulleted list.

## Office Experiences

### The first year-ish...

- Since we were a tech (tm) company, we had to have an open office. There were half wall dividers between the rows and no gaps between the seats in the rows. This was pretty miserable because everytime myself and the other new hire wanted to discuss *anything* between us (i.e. how to install Java), we had to do it in front of the row of senior engineers and managers. I don't they cared, but it was embarassing all the same.

- One third of the team came in, *maybe*, one day a week. This included both of the tech leads I had for the first two years at the job. The rest of the team came in either everyday (me) or three times a week/however much they felt like.

- In my entire 4 years on that team, there was only *1* day where every single person on our 8ish person team were all there at the same time.

- If even 1 person is remote, meetings become a newly added responsibility for the team that's in the office. Somebody has to reserve the meeting room, come in a little early to the meeting room, make sure everything is working, hook up their laptop to the projector, dial into the call, etc. This resulted in either all our meetings starting 5 minutes late, or one of the engineers having the designated responsibility of "meeting runner" and showing up 5 minutes early to setup. I always found this a little cruel that the people who'd already sacrificed some of their day by coming into the office then get *another* responsibility to account for the people who didn't bother to come in.

- We had a foosball table because, again, we were a tech (tm) company. I don't really like foosball but I either had to play or get excluded from the "impromptu team bonding" event.

- We talked about race/culture *a lot*. We had team members from China, India, Bulgaria, Mexico, and the US so we discussed different traditions and practices quite a bit. This was pretty neat, but it also wasn't always a good thing. There was a bit of racial animus at times and we often skewed away from talking about us as individuals and instead to what Indians did or Chinese people did. I would describe it mostly as just odd.

### The second year-ish

I'd finished my 1 year stint of always going into the office and decided to only go in only 4 days a week. 

- Our company got bought and split into two seperate companies. The fancy "tech floor" (read: awful open office) was given to the marketing department. Tech got punted to shared, 4 person cubicles on the floor above. 60% of the floor was empty, which made this a very depressing place to work.

- I was the sole person in my "pod" that came in consistently. The guy in the adjacent cube block was ostensibly a database administrator, but he mostly just watched cricket all day on his computer. Being in the office is a constant reminder of just how little your coworkers really do.

- During this time, a product manager in my cubicle-group would come in once every two weeks(ish) at 6 in the morning and then leave at 2 p.m. Her logic was that she could "beat traffic" doing this but I always thought it kind of defeated the purpose of coming into the office if the office was empty most of the time you were there.

- A second move brought another (?) marketing department to the same floor and next to us. Ironically, having the floor full was *also* a little depressing. The marketing people seemed to be having a *great* time. They were all friends, they had cubicle decorating contests, they went out after work, and genuinely seemed to enjoy being there. I got to listen to the Cricket watcher talk about how many pull ups he could do on the phone. 

- To "properly give the tech team its space," we moved *again* to another floor a level down. This was designated "tech space" and was meant to enhance productivity by putting all the tech people next to each other. The problem was, we'd just been acquired by a mega-corp that was extremely supportive of remote work. Between that and the staff attrition, the "tech floor" was now 90% empty with *maybe* 15 people coming in semi-regularly. This was definitely the low point of in-office work.

- The aforementioned tech space had no common area. There were mostly single cubes but there was one "mega cube" which seated 4 people and had a small table in the center. I was in the mega-cube and, since there was no common area, that meant everybody ate at the small table right behind me. A lot. It was fairly annoying to be working, or have a lunch call, and then turn hear 4 people munching on chips. I don't really blame them, though, we didn't have any other space to eat.
