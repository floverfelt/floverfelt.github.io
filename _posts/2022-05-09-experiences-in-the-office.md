Remote work has been a pretty typical thing for the last two years and we're starting to hit the inflection point where people wonder if the office really wasn't so bad. Think of the productivity gains! The water cooler talk! The spontaneous ideation!

Lest we (myself included) all forget, this was my experience coming into the office.

## Context

I worked at a medium sized technology company that got acquired by a *really big* technology company. Since this was my first job out of college, I decided to go into the office everyday for the first year to prove... something? I'm still not sure what, exactly, but remote work didn't really appeal to me at the time and the gym was a half-block away from work so I knew I'd be going to the office to go to the gym most days anyway.
