William Gibson's [_Neuromancer_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) is one of my favorite books. That meant I spent a lot of [_Cyberpunk 2077_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077) vascillating between:

> Wow this is such a cool realization of Gibson's cyberpunk world!

And

> Wow this is such a _bad_ realization of Gibson's cyberpunk world!

## Cypberpunk 2077 is Neuromancer-lite

The plot of _Cyberpunk 2077_ is basically that of Neuromancer. No, it's not quite 1:1, but the plot beats are so close to being equivalent that it's almost laughable:

- Both begin(ish) with a heist of a human personality written to an AI block of code (an engram).
- The personality of the engram is very relevant to the story.
- They meet up with rastafarian hackers to hack/penetrate a Japanese mega-corporation.
- One of the company's henchman ultimately sides with the protaganist.
- AI's are lurking just behind a firewalled net and could escape at any moment.
- The engram AI is suffering and wants to be released from his cyber-hell.

I could go on - there's tons of little details throughout that are homage's to the book and/or just adaptation of those ideas. Yes, I know that _Neuromancer_ set the stage for (and invented) many core cyberpunk concepts, but still.

I wouldn't actually call this a fault in and of itself. It's only a fault because it so easily calls the comparison to the book, which has such a better plot and is overall such a superior piece of media, that it makes _Cyberpunk_ look pretty bland by comparison.

## Cyberpunk has a lot of cool concepts, without much to say

This is the core tension at the heart of this game: There's some some incredibly cool and novel ideas that go precisely nowhere.

### Johnny Silverhand

Video games are about living the imagined life of another. In _Cyberpunk_ V is the character and you are the player. The player is inhabiting the world of V, while V's world is being inhabited by the life of a 3rd character - Johnny. The player-character relationship is paralled in the V-Johnny relationship - both Johnny and you are living the voyeuristic life of another. Your actions affect V which affects Johnny which in turns affects your actions on V. And that's a really cool concept! There's three feedback loops running between you as you, you as the character, and Johnny.

V and Johnny's relationship makes great use of this. His plot/redemption arc, while a little hamfisted, is engaging and I really enjoyed it. Johnny being a complete self-absorbed asshole who inhabits your body was clever - the player remained the character (V) while experiencing the broader world, backstory, and concept. It's a neat conceit and it answered the meta-mechanical-question of video game story telling: How do you tell a multi-perspective story from a single character's experience and perspective?

I also played as a woman which was an interesting twist on the V-Johnny relationship that I thought made it a lot better. Johnny effectively transitioning into a woman when he took control of V's body was interesting as a premise and it changed how various sex scenes/gender dynamics felt - particularly when Johnny and Rogue go on their pseudo-date thing later in the game.

All-in-all, Johnny and V were such a cool pair. I didn't _like_ V (or Johnny) all that much, but the ideas were there, and they were well done. Unfortunately...

## Science fiction as a reflection

There's a famous quote or aphorism that goes something like:

> Science fiction isn't about the future, it's a commentary on today's society represented through the future.

Essentially, good science fiction _says something_. _Cyberpunk_ doesn't say a lot. It glances off ideas and plot beats without delving into them at all or really giving you a reason to care.

Take the probably central tenant of the game: _Corporations are bad_. Johnny hates them. Jackie hates them. Everybody hates them. But, well, why?

It's never really explained why Arasaka in particular is so evil. _You_ try to steal from them! Johnny detonates a nuclear weapon (killing countless innocent people no doubt) on their headquarters! And they don't even kill him outright for that - they copy him into code to live again someday.

I dunno, I just never got a sense of _why_ the central villain was bad. Takemura was one of the kindest, most honorable characters in the game. Hanako completely honors the deal you make with her at the end of the game and, in addition, allows you access to their company's latest and best technology. And we're supposed to root against them because... Johnny, a moronic, self-absorbed dumbass for much of the game, hates them?

I just didn't see it? I never had any reason to hate these people other than Johnny's backstory with Alt which was weak at best. The plot certainly never tied the actions of Arasaka to a relatable company today or made a real commentary about class and wealth. Sure, those things were _there_ in _Cyberpunk_ but they were all "tell not show."

Or take the Voodoo Boys. The idea of a shadow cyber war happening between AIs and the corporate net with an immenient collapse of all cyber security is really cool! And the game basically just drops it in there for a single quest and moves on. Nothing is said about it, it's just kind of like "Well this is a cyberpunk world and that's a thing that happens" and then moves on. Cyberpunk as a genre has something to say about AIs and the net for sure, but just plopping it in _Cyberpunk_ doesn't say anything new.

And the _whole game_ is like this! It's certainly cyberpunk, which is really great, it's a genre I love realized beautifully, but it's not science fiction in the way good cyberpunk should be.

## Braindances





There's no instigating action really that gives me any cause to hate Arasaka.
