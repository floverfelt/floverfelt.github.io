William Gibson's [_Neuromancer_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) is one of my favorite books. That meant I spent a lot of [_Cyberpunk 2077_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077) vascillating between:

> Wow this is such a cool realization of Gibson's cyberpunk world!

And

> Wow this is such a _bad_ realization of Gibson's cyberpunk world!

## Cypberpunk is Neuromancer-lite

The plot of _Cyberpunk 2077_ is basically that of Neuromancer. No, it's not quite 1:1, but the plot beats are so close to being equivalent that it's almost laughable:

- Both begin(ish) with a heist of a human personality written to an AI block of code (an engram).
- The personality of the engram is very relevant to the story.
- They meet up with rastafarian hackers to hack/penetrate a Japanese mega-corporation.
- One of the company's henchman ultimately sides with the protaganist.
- AI's are lurking just behind a firewalled net and could escape at any moment.
- The engram AI is suffering and wants to be released from his cyber-hell.

I could go on - there's tons of little details throughout that are homage's to the book and/or just adaptation of those ideas. Yes, I know that
