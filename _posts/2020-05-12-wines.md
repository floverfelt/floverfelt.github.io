## Wine Reviews

These are the wines I've tried and my thoughts on them, in no particular order.

* [Black Box Malbec](https://www.totalwine.com/wine/red-wine/malbec/black-box-malbec/p/110783030) - much less sweet than I expected. I generally prefer sweeter wines so this is not completely to my taste, but I'm enjoying it thus far. Not so dry that it's irritating to drink (though it is dry), and not so sweet that I'm drinking it too quickly. I should buy it again when I'm looking for wine to pair with food. 7/10

* [Black Box Red Sangria](https://www.totalwine.com/wine/fruit-wine/sangria/black-box-red-sangria/p/187985031) - I want to rate this one higher, but it's a hair too sweet and "juice" like for me. I like it a lot as an easy-to-drink Sangria, but the alcohol wasn't strong enough to offset the sweetness. I would buy it again, but probably not a first option of Sangria's. 7/10
