Ads have become incredibly ubiquitious and it sometimes gets to me. Even when we pay for things outright, they come loaded with ads.

I don't hate advertising or the advertising business model, but I do feel like we've lost something in no longer being able to go somewhere or buy something and truly own it for yourself.

Anyway, here's my catalogue of ads I've seen in unexpected (to me) places:

1. Car license plate holders. If you have a license plate holder (or a car for that matter) with the dealer's info on it, you're essentially a rolling advertisment for them.

2. Updating my graphics card drivers. Nvidia serves you ads when you use the installer to update your graphics card. Ads in installers are nothing really new, but it's been a while since I used one and forgot about it.

3. Hockey Games. It's boggling to me that you can pay $40+ dollars for a ticket to a Caps game and be essentially served ads the entire time - be it in the intermission shows, the banner ads, or the audio ads that play.
