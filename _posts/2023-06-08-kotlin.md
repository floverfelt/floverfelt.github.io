## Kotlin: I'm still not impressed?

I've used Kotlin twice - once at my previous job as the language of choice for a new project and then again over the past week for a new side project I've been coding up.

I'm... still not impressed with it? Despite all the hype on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14362975) over the years it seems... just fine?

I remember picking up Node a few years ago and I could more or less instantly see the value add - the frontend and the backend are in the same language, it's straightforward to read/write with optional typing with Typescript, and it's fairly performant with a large ecosystem.

With Kotlin, I didn't really have that moment at all. It seemed to have some neat features and allows more functional & flexible patterns, but that was really it. It did make me think, though, what do I value in a programming language?

## Terseness is overrated

Let's look at the (tired) joke about how verbose it is to run a method in Java:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```

Vs. Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Yes - Kotlin is shorter, easier to read, and easier to type. That's a kind of nice benefit? But I have a lot of problems with the whole "which language is easiest to write a main() method in" debate.

First, programs do a lot of things beginners don't understand. I remember the professor teaching us the whole *static void main...* thing and thinking - huh, ok those are the keywords to get the program to run. I didn't care about what static or public or void or main or String meant *because I was a beginner.* I didn't know what an IDE was but I was using that. I didn't know what a compiler was! Or a programming language! Magic words that make things happen was more-or-less my understanding of programming, a few extra here or there was not the hurdle that was preventing me from learning.

Second, you don't write this method all that much in professional development? I've been writing a CLI recently and that's required quite a few main() methods, but before that I can count on (maybe) both hands the number of times I've really needed to write the full *static void main...* signature at work. In those rare cases, yes, it would have been nice for it to be shorter.

Third, terse languages often trade types for brevity. That's a fair trade-off to make, but I feel like it negates any benefit of the whole "this language is easier to learn because the main method is simpler" argument.

```java
SomeObject someObj = new SomeObject();
```

Is redundant to a professional developer, but to a beginner it's much easier to read with the type on the left *and* the right. It's just kind of funny that engineers roll out the main() example and then often omit what's *lost* when you drop all those types.

Finally, and this may just come down to personal preference, but is my life really all that much better off with fewer lines of code? Or without semi-colons? Do I care? I'm an engineer to build things. I don't really care about the brevity of the code I type as long as it gets the job done in a reasonable way and:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  
}
```

Is not unreasonable to me? I dunno, I wonder what could have been built if JetBrains had just stuck with Java and built several new products instead of investing so heavily in Kotlin. Would Kotlin be missed?
