## Kotlin: I'm still not impressed?

I've used Kotlin twice - once at my previous job as the language of choice for a new project and then again over the past week for a new side project I've been coding up.

I'm... still not impressed with it? Despite all the hype on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14362975) over the years it seems... just fine?

I remember picking up Node a few years ago and I could more or less instantly see the value add - the frontend and the backend are in the same language, it's straightforward to read/write with optional typing with Typescript, and it's fairly performant with a large ecosystem.

With Kotlin, I didn't really have that moment at all. It seemed to have some neat features and allows more functional & flexible patterns, but that was really it. It did make me think, though, what do I value in a programming language?

## Terseness is overrated

Let's look at the (tired) joke about how verbose it is to run a method in Java:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```

Vs. Kotlin
