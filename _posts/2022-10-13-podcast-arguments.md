I want podcast hosts to argue more with their guests.

Not politely push back, or respectfully disagree, but legitametely argue with them and hold them to their points. Why? Because podcasts are getting dull.

## Television, the void, and David Foster Wallace

David Foster Wallace has [a great essay about television](https://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf) where (one of) his overarching points is that we've started watching so much television that we're starting to mistake it for reality.

You'd think this is a banal point. *Of course* Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe can't live in a gorgeous NYC flat in *Friends*. *Obviously* a dull office job with a horrible manager wouldn't be as fun as *The Office*. *House* isn't a real doctor. You get the idea...

And yet, I've met a lot of friends who were desperately trying to make their lives reflect those shows in one myriad way or another. Or worse, they were simply disappointed that their lives *weren't* whatever show they were watching was.

Our mind believes the myth of television just enough to be entraped by it, but still maintains that rational aloofness when asked directly. Foster (at some point) illustrates this with the Nietzsche'ian abyss:

> And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

If you watch enough television, television starts to become your reality.

## The Abyss of Podcasting

If the problem with television is that it makes you think everyone is pretty, charming, and living the life you want, what's podcasting (as a medium) making you think?

That everyone has a well articulated, structured and thought out opinion about everything. And their opinion is right (more on that later)!

Most people *don't* have opinions about these things and they *definitely* aren't well thought out. I once asked a person who was working in higher education what they thought about [the Varsity Blues scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Blues_scandal) and essentially got the response "It's bad."

I asked an accountant friend of mine about the [2008 Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) and his response was "It's just bad mortgages."

Even in fields in which people have deep knowledge, they tend not to have thesis like statements ready to go at the drop of a hat. And that's totally fine!

But, if you listen to enough podcasts, it starts to seem like everyone is this super well-informed, articulate, and opinionated orator on a bevy of topics.

### Who's on most podcasts

People nowadays who go on podcasts are professional opinion holders. They're journalists, public speakers, public intellectuals, activists, comedians, that kind of thing.

Scott Alexander made a good point that writing a book these days is not actually about the book, it's about [using the book as a public relations campaign](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-what-we-owe-the-future). Podcasts are starting to fall into that bucket. They're not what their billed - as "two people having a discussion" - but rather, one person pontificating with light interjections by the host.

A fun experiment is to listen to the same guest across multiple podcasts. Not short form "news bit" podcasts but the longer, 1hr+ podcasts. They're essentially reciting the exact same stories, the same points, the same opinions, over and over again. I'm not naive here, *that's why they're on the podcast is to promote some thing*, but it does seem like such a missed opportunity. Everybody is just a little *too* polite and a little *too* accomadating. I'd rather have the hosts push back or play devils advocate a bit instead of just letting the guest opine about this or that.

Arthur Brooks is currently promoting one of his books and went on [Sam Harris'](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/291-where-is-happiness) podcast and [Peter Attia's](https://peterattiamd.com/arthurbrooks/). He tells the exact same French Horn-ist turned surgeon story in both. He talks about the same mysterious super famous, priveledged man on a plane who can't find happiness. It's *almost* the exact same discussion across both podcasts. 

And it's not bad! But it's not particularly engaging either. These are professional opinion holders, press them on their opinions.

### What's it like to go on a podcast

Podcasts are (typically) one-on-one conversations in a relatively low production value environment. A lot of podcasters operate out of studios in their homes. You get "invited" on. It's all very collegial.

I think this is great and the friendly atmosphere among podcasters is one of the things that makes it great. But, that does make it a lot harder to contradict your guests. Nobody wants to invite somebody into their home and then berate them about their opinions for an hour or more. And, likewise, nobody wants to go to somebody's house where they're being raked over the coals for an hour or more!

We need at least an adjustment to that culture. As a guest, I'm expecting to be treated with respect, kindness, and in good faith, but not at the expense of a good old-fashioned argument.

### Is longform the answer?

Every discussion of podcasts inevitably talks about Joe Rogan, and so, here I am. *A* reason he's so popular (god knows [we've](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/business/joe-rogan.html) [had](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/joe-rogan-neil-young-feud-spotify-music-streaming-industry) [enough](https://www.vox.com/culture/22945864/joe-rogan-politics-spotify-controversy) [discussion](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/my-joe-rogan-experience/594802/) of *the* reason he's so popular), is that the podcast-format is so long that the guest eventually gets sidetracked and discusses something off-kilter. Those tangents and digressions are usually more interesting than the topic itself, and often reveal quite a bit about the guest. 

Matt Yglesias [went on Joe's podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0JwtEENqDW0DbpNRHh7ekh) a while ago and then posted [a pretty interesting follow up about their tangent around his weight](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1527715941173366785?lang=en)(there's a longer substack out there somewhere about this). Joe could have handled this... a lot better, but those kind of side tracks are what makes the longer form podcast a bit more interesting.

Length isn't sufficient for interest though. Lex Fridman had [John Carmack](https://lexfridman.com/john-carmack/) on a while back. Carmack is doing AI research these days and pretty baldly states that he's *completely uninterested in the philosophical notion that it's impossible to create an AI*. And then they just move on!

Perhaps we should have stuck with that a little longer? A premenient computer scientist dismissing another field of study outright is not a good thing! What's his response to those arguments? Has he thought deeply about the philosophical thought experiments? How does he respond? That's a lot more interesting than what IDE he uses...

### Good Arguments, Bad Arguments

To be clear, straight argumentation is *not* the answer. There's countless JRE podcasts where the guests butt heads and [it's completely uninteresting](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6civXCl6aIUJGFyHqkiPlQ). There's a number of Sam Harris podcasts [like that](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/32-the-best-podcast-ever/id733163012?i=1000364700660) as well.

There's a way to strike a balance. To linger on points for a couple more minutes instead of moving on. To prod at somebody without offending them. To go off on tangents that seem unrelated.

## Who's doing this right?

Some good examples of this recently:
