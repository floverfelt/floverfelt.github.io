I thought ["Avernum 3: Ruined World"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernum_3:_Ruined_World) was all-in-all a good experience that suffered a slow and steady decline beginning around the 20 hour mark.
In total, the game took me ~40 hours to complete and while I enjoyed it, I don't think I'll return.

## The Beginning

I played the shareware version of this game as a kid when it was ["Exile 3: Ruined World"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(1995_video_game_series)), which looking back, is kind of odd. I have no idea how we got ahold of this game? We had internet and a computer and all, but downloading things off websites wasn't something we did back then. Maybe it was on a demo disk? Oh well. All this to say, my experience with this game my be colored by my childhood biases.

The best part of this game is definitely the beginning. Exploring Fort Emergence and discovering the plagues was a lot of fun and it definitely brought back that sense of wonder/excitement from the original game. I feel like the modern art style relies too much on drab grays, but then again, the original was aggressively colorful so it may be an unfair comparison.

The combat is engaging, the progression is well paced, and the game is pretty great. In fact, it remains at this high peak for a good long time - until about when you meet Empress Prazac which I'll semi-arbitrarily term the midpoint of the game.

## The Middle Section

This is where the game begins to show its faults. The core quest loop if you will is: Find plague, defeat, go back to Avernum, find next plague, defeat, etc.

This is pretty fun, but it starts to tire around the point of the Hill Giants (I'm assuming here you did the plagues in order).
