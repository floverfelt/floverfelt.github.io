## Black Mesa Review

I'm not entirely sure I have anything novel to add here, but in the spirit of writing more, I thought I'd post a reivew of the game ["Black Mesa."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game))

For some context, this is the fan remake of the original [Half Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) game. I was a bit too young to play that at the time and I don't really have any nostalgic ties to it. I remember playing Half Life for the first time when I was 13 and enjoying it but being somewhat underwhelmed.

The feeling has remained now, though that's not to say Black Mesa is a bad game by any means. I'm just still unclear as to what makes these games truly "great" by others standards.

### Chapters 01 - 04

These are hands down the best part of the game. "Black Mesa Inbound" through "Office Complex." The early exploration, messing around with your coworkers, the cascade and discovery of the alien like creatures. It's a real treat to experience and I think the best part of the game.

I found Black Mesa in general did a much better job of fleshing out the horror that the scientists experienced during the Black Mesa Incident. There's some pretty terrifying moments (for them and us) where they are eaten by headcrabs, sucked into vents, etc. This is definitely helped along by the graphics, but I appreciated the small touches of dialogue and the general sense of fear evoked by the environment.

### Chapters 05 - 10, 12, 13

I feel as if the game lags a lot in the middle. The pacing in general is my biggest issue with this game (and Half Life by extension I suppose). It's not bad per-se but I definitely felt as if some chapters took forever to finish and others whipped by. Especially in the middle, there's only so many marines, aliens, and jump puzzles you can go through before wondering what's next.

I especially felt that way during Surface Tension. The game truly lags there. I found being outdoors but still confined to what are essentially corridors in the cliffs frustrating. The office complex levels integrate the architecture of the buildings into the linerity of the game, whereas the outdoor areas just feel cramped and frustrating.

### Chapters 11 & 14

I thought these were terrific levels and probably my favorite in the game. Exploring the labs in "Questionable Ethics" was new and challenging and (for once) I thought an escort mission was done well. You were given the tools necessary to succeed, a semi-open area to move around in, and clear objectives. That, coupled with the unique Half Life physics and button puzzles made this a great little segment of the game.

Likewise for "Lambda Core." It was akin to being in a digital playground and finding your way through. I didn't feel as confied or the game to be as repetive through here as a result. 

### Chapters 15 - 18, Zen & the rest of it
