## Beer Reviews

Different beers that I've tried. In no particular order.

* [Starr Hill - Carly Cucumber Gose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starr_Hill_Brewery) - a suprisingly delicious beer. Retains enough of the cucumber flavor to taste refreshing and yet this doesn't clash with the hoppy sour. Delicious and subtle, though I do wish it had a higher ABV. 8/10
