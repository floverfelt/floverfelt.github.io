## Beer Reviews

Different beers that I've tried. In no particular order.

* [Starr Hill - Carly Cucumber Gose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starr_Hill_Brewery) - a suprisingly delicious beer. Retains enough of the cucumber flavor to taste refreshing and yet this doesn't clash with the hoppy sour. Delicious and subtle, though I do wish it had a higher ABV. 8/10

* [St. Pauli Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pauli_Girl) - a terrific lager. Slightly sweeter than the other green bottle beers I've had and a good easy drink after mowing the lawn or something. 9/10

* [Blue Moon Belgian White](www.bluemoonbrewingcompany.com) - decent beer, but I the taste is too in-between a truly light beer and a lager for me to love it. 7/10
