I spend a lot of time on the internet - for work and otherwise - and consequently I spend a lot of time on social networks. Twitter, Reddit, and HackerNews have all been mainstays of my Internet-diet and I've noticed a similar relationship arc with each that I thought I'd reflect on.

## The value-add period

I think you could probably also call this "the honeymoon phase" or any other trite terminology. Either way, this period was characterized by genuine excitement, interest and engagement. I remember this especially with Reddit in my early college years - slightly edgy, funny, and heterodox ideas all which I had a (seemingly) infinite time to consume. 

Likewise with Hacker News. I was deeply bored at work and finally found a place where people were interested in discussing technology. They had opinions and seemed to know what they were talking about! So much expertise in one place! I could browse to my heart's content, call it work, and be exposed to new coding paradigms, languages, and ways of thinking. And [I legitametely think it was pretty helpful for me at the time](https://floverfelt.org/posts/hackernews).

## No longer reading the content

I think I hit a point with most social media where I stop actually reading the content. I'm not sure why, but I've noticed this pattern a lot anymore - open up the app, read the headline, jump to the comments.

My theory is that the community in-aggregate is typically more lizard brain interesting than the actual content. Hearing why somebody is wrong is always more salacious than reading what somebody's done. The comments often have (admittedly) bad summaries of what the article's about so it feels like you've read the article anyway, even if you haven't.

## Realizing the sameyness

This is the point I'm at with most of the social media I use these days. You've spent enough time there that you can guess, about 80% of the time, what's going to be said about any given issue.

I don't need to read the comments. I don't (most of the time) need to even read the post. I can typically guess *why* something's there and *what* people are saying about it.

This is the oft mentioned "hive mind" of social media and it's very much a real thing. Comments and postings all follow a zeitgest that feed a narrative and my god does it get old. 

I feel like at this point in the lifecycle of a social media network, I'm so tantalized by the genuine use and curiousity that the honeymoon phase gave me that I'm essentially addicted to it in the hopes that it'll give me some utility again someday.

### Reddit is a deeply dysfunctional place

The default Reddit experience has a lot of problems, first and foremost:

Reddit normalizes a lot of very dysfunctional and bizarre behavior under the guise of being supportive or helpful.

This is *just* on the first two pages of Reddit, as I write this:

- A post from [/r/AITAH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/), which is almost certainly made up, where the author is seeking validation from random strangers for an odd, dumb, but relatively inconsequential social situation. As a general rule - *seeking validation from strangers on the internet is a bad idea!* It's also really, really weird! This person should not be posting this and thousands of people should not be replying! The problem with all of these style subreddits is two-fold. First, the person posting is almost never giving a full context. I know, I've tried to describe situations and context in other posts and it's *literally impossible to give a full accounting of something in a text post*. You're getting a lopsided picture from the get-go. Second, the people replying have zero stake in the outcome so they have no incentive to provide accurate information.
