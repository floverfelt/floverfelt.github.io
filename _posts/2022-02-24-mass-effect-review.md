I bought [Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect) Legendary Edition over Christmas and I've been playing through the series again for the first time in ages.

The original Mass Effect is a really solid, 8/10 game that's remembered for being a lot worse than it actually is.

There's a solid (albeit typical) story about the end of the galaxy due an unknown threat from "deep space." The combat is a decent shoot-em-up and the character writing is top notch. None of it is perfect, but it comes together as a better-than-the-sum-of-its-parts game.

## The Worldbuilding

Science fiction is often described as a reflection on the society it's written in, and Mass Effect leans into this premise - hard. There's a dozen (?) or so alien species and *all* of them are racist in some form or another. Turians hate humans. Humans hate Turians. The Salarians and Turians quite literally commit genocide against the Krogan. The Krogan commit genocide against the sentient Rachni.

Earth is a messy place and by extension so is the galaxy. The Mass Effect's universe is why you play Mass Effect. It's totally original and really well built. Each species is vying for different things and everybody occupies a morally grey space - including the humans. Are all species alike in their lust for power? Is it possible to form a multi-species democracy? Great stuff.

### The Turians, Asari, Quarians, and Salarians

These were probably the least interesting set of aliens to me. I lamented in my [Speaker for the Dead](https://floverfelt.org/posts/speaker-for-the-dead-analysis-1) review that too many portrayals of aliens are just blue humans. And the Turians, Asari, Quarians, and Salarians are essentially reskinned humans. Especially the Turians.

They have interesting backstories and lore, but ultimately they felt like trait accentuated humans. Asari are humans but with telekenisis! Salarians are humans but super scientific! Quarians are... jewish/gypsies?

Like I said, the game makes up for this by making them *interesting* twists on humanity, but they're humans nonetheless.
