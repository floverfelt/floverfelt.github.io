I bought [Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect) Legendary Edition over Christmas and I've been playing through the series again for the first time in ages.

The original Mass Effect is a really solid, 8/10 game that's remembered for being a lot worse than it actually is.

There's a solid (albeit typical) story about the end of the galaxy due an unknown threat from "deep space." The combat is a decent shoot-em-up and the character writing is top notch. None of it is perfect, but it comes together as a better-than-the-sum-of-its-parts game.

## The Worldbuilding

Science fiction is often described as a reflection on the society it's written in, and Mass Effect leans into this premise - hard. There's a dozen (?) or so alien species and *all* of them are racist in some form or another. Turians hate humans. Humans hate Turians. The Salarians and Turians quite literally commit genocide against the Krogan. The Krogan commit genocide against the sentient Rachni.

Earth is a messy place and by extension so is the galaxy. The Mass Effect's universe is why you play Mass Effect. It's totally original and really well built. Each species is vying for different things and everybody occupies a morally grey space - including the humans. Are all species alike in their lust for power? Is it possible to form a multi-species democracy? Great stuff.

### The Turians, Asari, Quarians, and Salarians

These were probably the least interesting set of aliens to me. I lamented in my [Speaker for the Dead](https://floverfelt.org/posts/speaker-for-the-dead-analysis-1) review that too many portrayals of aliens are just blue humans. And the Turians, Asari, Quarians, and Salarians are essentially blue humans. Especially the Turians.

They have interesting backstories and lore, but ultimately they felt like trait accentuated humanity. Asari are humans but with telekenisis! Salarians are humans but super scientific! Quarians are... jewish/gypsies?

Like I said, the game makes up for this by making them *interesting* twists on humanity, but they're all too human for me.

I'm optimistic that the later games will make up for this, but in the original iteration, they just feel like reskins of somewhat tired tropes.

### The Geth

The Geth somewhat fall into the above category too, but I actually found them quite interesting. An enduring and poignant question the game asks is: When do you recognize another species as "worthy" to enter the galactic council?

The Geth may be strange but I find it surprising that they are so blanketly *evil* in Mass Effect. The Krogans rebelled and killed countless galactic lives, but they're recognized and respected as are the Batarians who are literal slavers. I'm not saying they deserve to be on the Council or whatever, but I do find it interesting how castigated the Geth are. Which leads into a broader, more interesting conversation...

### The Council is a crumbled power structure

Mass Effect does a great job of reflecting reality, and The Council is a failing Rome that's doing nothing but preserving the power and wealth it already has. I'm not sure if this is the *intended* message of the game, but it was my takeaway:

1. They are extremely hesitant to admit and share power with species who already rival them (humans in this case).
2. They denude any species which has the potential to oppose them.
3. They recongize no power other than force.

This is all *classic* totalitarian leadership and the Council masks it by marketing themselves as democratic, shared leadership.

Let's take these points beat-by-beat. Why are humans not on the Council? Is it because they are relative newcomers? That's the excuse that's given, but then why are the Krogan not on the council? Or the Batarians? Or the Quarians? 

These are all free, sentient species that deserve representation no? The Council seems to only exist to serve the interests of the races *on* the Council not represent the Galactic people.
