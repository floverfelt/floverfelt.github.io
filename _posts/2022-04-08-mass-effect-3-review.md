Is [Mass Effect 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3) a great game? 

It's really, really hard to say. On the one hand, it tackles almost every single plotline [that I took issue with](https://floverfelt.org/posts/mass-effect-review) in the first game: The Geth are fully realized characters, the Quarian plotline is fleshed out, the genophage is dealt with. When Mass Effect 3 hits its major plot points, it's *incredibly* good. 

The problem is - for the rest of the game, I just didn't care all that much?

## A Return to the Alliance

In ME1, you're very briefly a part of the Alliance military before becoming a Spectre. After that, you're pretty much given free reign to do whatever you want. You don't have to interact with Admiral Hackett or Anderson if you don't want to. You don't even have to talk to the Council if you don't want to.

So while you're ostensibly "part of the Alliance" in Mass Effect 1, its not really a "military" game.

Mass Effect 3 is a military game. You're not a lone wanderer amidst the stars. You're an Alliance commander representing Earth's fleet.

This was a pretty jarring change for me. The game confidently acts like this is the logical outcome after ME2 - back to business on Earth. But it's not! At all! Shephard could have been sympathetic with Cerberus and allied with the Illusive man. He could've turned his back on the Alliance altogether and joined up with the Council Spectres. Besides, if it was so easy to just nope out of the Illusive Man's contract, why didn't Shephard do it sooner?

It's so odd that the game essentially resets to the beginning of Mass Effect 1 with no acknowledgement that this is kind of... abrupt?
