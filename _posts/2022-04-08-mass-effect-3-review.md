Is [Mass Effect 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3) a great game? 

It's really, really hard to say. On the one hand, it tackles almost every single plotline [that I took issue with](https://floverfelt.org/posts/mass-effect-review) in the first game: The Geth are fully realized characters, the Quarian plotline is fleshed out, the genophage is dealt with. When Mass Effect 3 hits its major plot points, it's *incredibly* good. 

The problem is - for the rest of the game, I just didn't care all that much?

## A Return to the Alliance

In ME1, you're very briefly a part of the Alliance military before becoming a Spectre. After that, you're pretty much given free reign to do whatever you want. You don't have to interact with Admiral Hackett or Anderson if you don't want to. You don't even have to talk to the Council if you don't want to.

So while you're ostensibly "part of the Alliance" in Mass Effect 1, its not really a "military" game.

Mass Effect 3 is a military game. You're not a lone wanderer amidst the stars. You're an Alliance commander representing Earth's fleet.

This was a pretty jarring change for me. The game confidently acts like this is the logical outcome after ME2 - back to business on Earth. But it's not! At all! Shephard could have been sympathetic with Cerberus and allied with the Illusive man. He could've turned his back on the Alliance altogether and joined up with the Council Spectres. Besides, if it was so easy to just nope out of the Illusive Man's contract, why didn't Shephard do it sooner?

It's so odd that the game essentially resets to the beginning of Mass Effect 1 with basically zero transition. That said, it makes a lot more sense after you realize that...

## Mass Effect 3 is a War Game

There's a lot of fuss made in game criticism over how a game's gameplay relates to its underlying themes. Say what you want about ME3, but it does an *great* job of relating the gameplay to the world its set in. This is a universe at war, and the game *feels* like it. 

The combat has been revamped and upgraded a lot, the pace of everything is much faster, and the dialogue is shorter and snappier. Some of this has been attributed to rushed development, but it also fits here. This is a game about wartime. Things are meant to be a little more brusque. The combat and fighting *should* be the focus of a game about an inter-galactic war.

It's a neat idea, but Mass Effect 3 can't *quite* pull it off. The tired trope of space Marine fighting for Earth is tired here too. Admiral Hackett is a dull character, and, frankly, so is Captain Anderson. The combat is much improved, but it's still pretty lackluster compared to an FPS or 3rd person shooter.

As a result, swaths of the game are just... dull. I didn't really care about collecting war supplies or helping Hackett with some mission to shore up defenses against the Reapers. The world of Mass Effect is what makes it an interesting series, the central plot - often less so.

## The Central Plot

The main plot of the game I could not track with. The Reapers are shown, repeatedly, to be damn near unkillable. It takes the *entire* human fleet to destroy *one* Reaper in the first game. Thousands of these things are attacking Earth and millions (?) more are attacking the rest of the galaxy.

But, early-on in the game, humans discover the Crucible which can completely obliterate the Reapers. I was hoping the game would play out similar to Mass Effect 1 - you go on a galaxy hopping expedition to recover pieces of the Crucbile, assemble it, and win. That would have made sense.

But you don't! Instead, you collect a bunch of "war assets" to fight the Reapers with. Such indomitable forces as a military news reporter and some mercenary ships. Why bother! That's going to do *nothing* against this force. You're better off investing your time and energy in building and assembling the Crucible as quickly as possible. So, that's what I did and then missed half the game since what you're "supposed" to be doing is building up a literal warchest.

The entire premise of the war assets system only makes sense within the context of the game's ending. You need the fleets & soldiers as a distraction to prevent the Crucible from being destroyed, but that makes no sense on the first play of the game.
