The [Hitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_(franchise)) games are video games distilled to their rawest essence: You're dropped into a richly realized world to live out a wild fantasy. I love the series because of just how unprentious it is - This game knows exactly what it wants to be, and it excels at it. 

## The Premise

You are a hitman. A contract killer. A stone cold badass. The game plops you off in some setting, you find some people and you kill them. That's it.

Nominally there is a plot but it's generic and fairly dumb. 

The richness of these games lies in their execution (ha!) not their premise. Each level is isolated from the others and relatively constrained. This means the developers can (and do) pay particular attention to every facet of the level design. In fact, that kind of _is_ the game. There's multiple ways to kill your target. There's plotlines within plotlines within plotlines.
