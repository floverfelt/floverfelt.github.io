## floverfelt.org

This is the personal website and blog of [floverfelt](https://floverfelt.org).

This site is intended for my thoughts, projects, ideas, etc. on things I find interesting or am thinking about.

## Site Philosophy

I feel like too many personal sties/blogs/etc. attempt to create a faux digital-persona of the author. I'm trying to actively avoid doing that here and as result this site is what I want it to be and represents my ideal for a personal site - simple, evolving, and useful.

That said, I hope you, the reader, find the content here interesting and valuable as well.

## Logistics

I will add new to-do work as ["Issues" on my Github](https://github.com/floverfelt/floverfelt.github.io/issues). Feel free to contribute or add new suggestions there.

New blog posts will be in the [\_posts](https://github.com/floverfelt/floverfelt.github.io/tree/master/_posts) folder. I will post links to all of these in the "Posts" section.

Any external sites that I find valuable I'll store at the bottom under "Links."
